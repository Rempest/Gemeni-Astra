## 🚨 Problem

Spacecraft and satellites must often operate without real-time communication with Earth.  
In critical situations, delayed or incorrect decisions can lead to mission failure.

Traditional autonomy systems are rigid, while modern AI systems are often unsafe for direct control.

**The challenge:**  
How can an AI system make autonomous decisions in space **while remaining deterministic, explainable, and safe**?


## 💡 Solution

**Gemini-Astra** is an autonomous AI decision-making system designed for spacecraft and satellite operations.

It analyzes raw telemetry data, reasons using **Google Gemini 3**, and produces **strict, machine-readable commands** that are safe for direct integration with robotic or flight software.

> Gemini-Astra is **not a chatbot**.  
> It is designed as an **AI pilot operating under strict constraints, deterministic outputs, and safety validation**.


## 🤖 Why Gemini 3?

Gemini 3 is used **not as a text generator**, but as a **deterministic reasoning engine**.

Gemini 3 enables:
- Multimodal reasoning over complex telemetry data
- Low-latency inference for time-critical decisions
- Structured, machine-readable outputs (JSON only)
- Deterministic behavior required for safety-critical systems

This makes Gemini 3 suitable for **autonomous aerospace decision-making**, not just conversational AI.


## 🧠 System Architecture (OODA Loop)

Gemini-Astra follows the **OODA Loop** (Observe → Orient → Decide → Act),  
a decision-making model widely used in aerospace and defense systems.

Telemetry (telemetry.json)
↓
Observe: Data Ingestion
↓
Orient: AI Reasoning (Gemini 3)
↓
Decide: Deterministic Command Generation
↓
Act: Validated Command Output (command.json)
↓
Visualize: Mission Dashboard (Streamlit)


## 🧩 Core Components

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion
- **Input:** `telemetry.json`
- Simulated satellite telemetry:
  - battery level
  - oxygen pressure
  - subsystem status
  - fault flags
- Designed to mirror real spacecraft sensor streams


### 2️⃣ AI Reasoning Core
- Implemented in `brain_node.py`
- Uses `google-genai` SDK with **Gemini 3**
- Deterministic configuration:
  - `temperature = 0`

Gemini evaluates:
- anomaly type
- risk level
- recommended action
- priority


### 3️⃣ Safety & Deterministic Output
- AI output format: **strict JSON only**
- All commands are validated against a predefined whitelist:

```python
VALID_ACTIONS = [
  "ISOLATE_MODULE",
  "CLOSE_VALVE",
  "REDUCE_POWER",
  "REBOOT_SUBSYSTEM",
  "NO_ACTION"
]
```

This safety layer:

prevents hallucinated or unsafe commands

guarantees compatibility with real robotic controllers

enforces human-designed operational constraints

### 4️⃣ Interface & Monitoring

dashboard.py built with Streamlit

Displays:

live telemetry

detected anomalies

AI decisions

priority levels

Designed for mission operators and system monitoring.


Example Scenario

Input – telemetry.json
{
  "battery_level": 18,
  "oxygen_pressure": 92,
  "thermal_status": "nominal",
  "solar_panel_actuator": "fault"
}


Output – command.json
{
  "action": "ISOLATE_MODULE",
  "target": "solar_panel_actuator",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "confidence": 0.91
}

This demonstrates autonomous anomaly detection, reasoning, and safe decision output.

## Technical Stack

**Language:** Python 3.12

**AI Model:** Google Gemini 3

**AI SDK:** google-genai

**Decision Model:** Deterministic LLM reasoning (temperature = 0)

**UI:** Streamlit

**Design Pattern:** OODA Loop

**Target Integration:** ROS 2, SpaceROS, Fprime, robotic actuation systems


## Design Rationale

Low Latency: Gemini 3 enables fast decision-making for space environments

Safety First: Hard validation of AI outputs prevents unsafe behavior

Explainability: Structured reasoning accompanies every decision

Scalability: Architecture is designed for ROS 2 nodes and real-time telemetry

### How to Run (Local / GitHub Codespaces)
Follow these steps to deploy and test the autonomous mission logic:

**1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/Rempest/Gemeni-Astra.git
cd Gemeni-Astra
```
**2️⃣ Install Dependencies We use a lightweight set of libraries to ensure compatibility across all environments.**
```
pip install streamlit pandas google-genai --break-system-packages
```
**3️⃣ Configure Authentication Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio and set it as an environment variable.**
```
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"
```

**4️⃣ Execute the Autonomous Mission Loop Run the primary entry point to start the Sense-Think-Act cycle.**
```
python3 run_mission.py
```
*What happens: The system loads satellite scenarios, analyzes telemetry via Gemini 3, executes recovery actions in the Logical Simulator, and validates safety constraints.*


**5️⃣ Review Mission Artifacts After execution, the system generates industrial-grade reports in the root directory:**

**_mission_log.json:* A full time-stamped timeline of every AI decision.

**_mission_summary.json:* A high-level executive summary for mission controllers (judges).


**6️⃣ Launch the Visual Dashboard (Optional) To visualize the telemetry data and AI reasoning in a web interface:**
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
Note: In Codespaces, go to the Ports tab and click the globe icon for port 8501.
```


### 🚀 Future Roadmap

🔹 ROS 2 integration (command publisher nodes)

🔹 SpaceROS compatibility for flight-grade software

🔹 MoveIt 2 integration for robotic repair and manipulation

🔹 Real-time telemetry streaming (DDS)

🔹 Hardware-in-the-loop simulation

🔹 Fault injection testing and certification-ready pipelines

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a *prototype developed for a hackathon environment.*

It is not *flight-certified software*, but it is architected with real aerospace constraints, safety considerations, and autonomous system principles in mind.
